Snippets were written by me, but feel free to get them for you if you like, they were made (and tested) for and to Vsnip in neovim, but they should work with vscode aswell.

Good luck.

“It is difficult to know what will be a waste of time until after the time has been wasted, by which time it is too late. So predicting what will be a waste of time is something of a waste of time. Unless it gives you pleasure, of course when it probably doesn’t count as a waste of time.”
